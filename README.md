# Research Network Figure - README

## Introduction
This Python script creates a visualization of a research network using the NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries. The script adds nodes and edges to a graph based on the roles and themes of members of the research network. The resulting visualization is saved as a PNG file.

## Requirements
To run this script, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine.
2. Open the script in a Python IDE or text editor.
3. Run the script.
4. The resulting visualization will be saved as a PNG file in the same directory as the script.

## Notes
- The node sizes and positions may need to be adjusted based on the size and complexity of your network.
- The colors and shapes of the nodes can be customized to fit your needs.
- The legend can be modified to reflect the roles and themes in your network.
- This script was last updated in September 2021 and uses Python 3.9.
